# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis in SQL Projects
**First Project:**

**Layoffs from Around the World:**

In this project I used MySQL to clean Data for Layoffs from Around the World data set and was able to do Exploratory Data Analysis with the clean data.

**Data Cleaning:**

This project focuses on data cleaning in MySQL, demonstrated how to prepare raw data for analysis by fixing issues in a dataset about global layoffs.

Highlights
•	📊 Database Creation: Started by creating a MySQL database to house my dataset.

•	📈 Real Dataset Import: Imported a dataset containing global layoffs data including company and location details.

•	🔧 Data Cleaning Techniques: Removed duplicates, standardize data formats, and handle null values.

•	🗃️ Row and Column Management: Removed unnecessary rows and columns to streamline the dataset.

•	💻 SQL Query Demonstration: Utilized SQL queries to manipulate and clean the dataset effectively.

•	✅ Data Integrity Assurance: Implemented staging tables to ensure the integrity of my cleaned data.

Key Insights

•	🛠️ Understanding Data Cleaning: Data cleaning is vital for accurate analysis, as it directly affects the quality of insights derived from datasets.

•	🔍 Identifying Duplicates: Using row numbers in SQL is an effective method to identify and remove duplicate entries, ensuring data uniqueness.

•	⚖️ Standardizing Data: Standardizing industry names and trimming white spaces are crucial for consistency, making it easier to analyze and compare data.

•	❓ Handling Null Values: Properly addressing null values is essential to avoid skewed results and ensure comprehensive data analysis.

•	🏗️ Staging Tables for Integrity: Using staging tables during the cleaning process helps maintain data integrity and allows for easier rollback if needed.

•	🗑️ Eliminating Unnecessary Data: Removing irrelevant rows and columns not only simplifies the dataset but also enhances performance during analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a cleaned dataset, examining layoffs by companies, industries, and trends over time.

Highlights

📊 Focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA) using a cleaned dataset.

🔍 Discovered insights without a specific agenda, exploring various data facets.

📈 Analyzed total layoffs, identifying peak layoffs from different companies.

🏢 Investigated layoffs across industries, revealing the hardest-hit sectors.

🌍 Examined layoffs by country, highlighting significant job losses globally.

📅 Explored trends over time, particularly through rolling totals and year comparisons.

📈 Emphasized the importance of data cleaning and visualization in EDA.

Key Insights

📉 The dataset reveals significant layoffs during the pandemic, with tech companies like Amazon and Google leading.

🏭 Industries such as retail and consumer services faced the highest layoffs, likely due to pandemic-related disruptions.

🌐 The U.S. dominated the layoffs data, indicating larger corporate layoffs compared to other countries.

🗓️ Analyzing layoffs by year shows a progressive increase, with 2022 being the worst year for layoffs recorded.

🔄 Rolling totals provide a clearer picture of layoffs over time, helping visualize trends and peaks.

📊 Multiple CTEs (Common Table Expressions) are useful for complex queries, allowing for detailed insights by year and company.


**Second Project:**

Covid-19 Deaths:

In this project I used Microsoft SQL Server to clean data for Covid Deaths data set and explored the data using different SQL quaries. 

Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

I imported Excel data into a SQL database and conducted in-depth analysis to calculate key metrics such as death percentages and infection rates. I leveraged Tableau Public to visualize the data, exploring global trends in deaths and vaccinations by continent. This project deepened my SQL skills, particularly in creating views and temporary tables, and showcased my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights through effective visualization. By analyzing data on a global scale, I developed a strong understanding of broader health trends and challenges.
